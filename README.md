**Data Storytelling Approach:**

1. Set the context: Describe the business challenge or question the dashboard aims to address - reducing attrition.

2. Present key insights: Highlight the most significant findings from the data - high attrition in Sales department, married employees, and 25-34 age group. 

3. Humanize with personas: Bring insights to life through representative personas like "Mike, a 32 year-old married Sales rep with low job satisfaction."

4. Tell a cohesive story: Connect the insights to tell a story - "Our data shows married employees like Mike in Sales in their early 30s have the highest attrition. Job satisfaction also appears to be a factor." 

5. Close with recommendations: End with potential solutions to address the problem based on the data story told - "We should focus retention efforts on Sales dept, improve job satisfaction among 30-somethings, and provide better support to married employees."
